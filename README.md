- [ ] Other: _hover effects on Buttons______________

### Challenges & Solutions
[Some of the Challenges i faced were as follows
1. Challenge: Making the project cards responsive across three breakpoints this was one of my toughest challenges.
Solution: Used CSS Grid with grid-template-columns: 1fr (mobile), repeat(2, 1fr) (tablet), and repeat(3, 1fr) (desktop). Added a fourth column for large desktops to showcase extra projects.

2. Challenge: Maintaining consistent spacing with custom properties and this was my second toughest challenge i faced.
Solution: Defined a spacing scale (--spacing-xs to --spacing-xl) and applied it throughout, making adjustments in media queries only when necessary.]
